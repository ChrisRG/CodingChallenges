# Leetcode challenges

To run rust scripts, I'm using [cargo-script](https://github.com/DanielKeep/cargo-script)

Installation:
```cargo install cargo-script```

Usage (with dependencies):
```cargo script -D hyper -D serde_json script.rs```

Additional options:
[rust-script](https://rust-script.org/)

For example, to run the example script in this directory:
```
cargo install cargo-script
cargo script example-script.rs
```
